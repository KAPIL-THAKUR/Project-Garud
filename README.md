# Project Garud

*Project Garud an emergency oriented management and disaster preparedness software for
humanitarian assistance. The ultimate agenda of this Project Garud is to make high quality
information management systems for emergency preparedness response recovery and
resilience building accessible to all in case of natural disaster like earthquake.
It is the need of the hour to create awareness regarding disaster management as there occurs a
huge loss of life and property.

*On a brief note with the help of this "Project Garud" people can be guided and informed about
the upcoming disaster and they can see proper assistance and rescue operations. At this time
natural disasters have become the so-called "regular disturbances" that cause destruction and it
is our group effort that we are reflecting in the team project entitled "PROJECT GARUD" for
the sake of human safety and timely reporting of the disastrous event otherwise the results can
be catastrophic.

*Humanitarian assistance, timely reporting of the disaster, nearest safe place identification
precautionary measure guidance etc are some of the key characteristics and functionalities that
software can provide.
