# Project Garud

* Project Garud an emergency oriented management and disaster preparedness software for
humanitarian assistance. The ultimate agenda of this Project Garud is to make high quality
information management systems for emergency preparedness response recovery and
resilience building accessible to all in case of natural disaster like earthquake.

* On a brief note with the help of this "Project Garud" people can be guided and informed about
the upcoming disaster and they can see proper assistance and rescue operations. At this time
natural disasters have become the so-called "regular disturbances" that cause destruction and it
is our group effort that we are reflecting in the team project entitled "PROJECT GARUD" for
the sake of human safety and timely reporting of the disastrous event otherwise the results can
be catastrophic.

* Humanitarian assistance, timely reporting of the disaster, nearest safe place identification
precautionary measure guidance etc are some of the key characteristics and functionalities that
software can provide.

* From sudden shaking to seismicity, Saldang to Kashmir, San Andreas fault to rift valley fault, and from severe loss to mental illness: all create a mess and to cure such conditions the Project Garud is established. Today, natural disasters have become the everyday events that lead to ecological imbalance, loss of life & property & severe disturbances that increase human obstacles. So, the making of project Garud is a initiative that is taken by the team Rebels to encourage & practice the risk mitigation, monitoring & management before, during & after the occurrence of natural disasters such as earthquake that is caused by the sudden movement of earth’s crust. 

* The basic perception of our proposition is to rescue as many people as possible during natural disasters as there is a huge loss of life & property.

* For instance, this project manages & deals with the live location of all the people in the locality during an earthquake and sends it to all the different sectors including NGO, hospitals and rescue teams for human alert & awareness. 
In the making of this project, all the latest technologies & methodologies with the usage of IBM services, Garud is built to resolve this great menace of disaster management & to make the system compatible, efficient & integrated.
 
* Further plan is to build an AI system which checks whether a building is safe or not.

* The overall functioning of this project is totally dedicated to human welfare & wellbeing so that the destruction that is caused by the disaster can be taken into consideration & can be managed to some extent. There is no exaggeration to the fact that the natural disasters are the destructive by -products of human acts. Today, human activities are contributing to these disasters. With the immediate need to minimise the hazardous human activities, there is a doubly immediate need to handle & seek solution to these hazards. Through the technicalities & human-friendly ideas that are included in this project.

* Human preparedness, awareness & rehabilitation are taken care of.

## Garud is broadly classified in 3 parts:-

1. Firstly (before an earthquake) :- Our architectural survey team will access all the buildings in the locality on the basis of strength, seismicity, elasticity, age and plasticity. It aggregates all that information and accumulate it in our Garud database, and then tag them as safe buildings with their information (address, latitude, longitude). Whenever there are chances for earthquake our application will send a notification regarding that and also shows them the safe buildings near them.

2. Secondly (during an earthquake) :- Live location of a being is stored in a real time database and then shared with all the rescue teams , and after some time users will get a push up notification asking them whether they are safe if they are then they have to click “yes” and their location marker will marked as green colour, if they don’t click yes then there live location is being detected and stored in our database, thus results in increasing the accuracy of rescuing the people.

3. Third (after an earthquake) :- Our smart system will analyse aerial drone images and access the damage done any prioritize the areas accordingly and the rescue team and the main concern is finding the location of people after earthquake. Devices will connect to it and the location is updated repeatedly. Once you are safe please mark yourself safe on our app so rescue team will know you are ok.

Hence, the basic crux or the gist of the project is fully based on the principles of disaster management that is the immediate need of the hour. 

## The following slogan sums this up neatly:
**Before, during & after
managing the circumstances with alertness & ease
to make people aware, to make people safe, to save life
is what the project Garud blissfully focuses on…..!**
